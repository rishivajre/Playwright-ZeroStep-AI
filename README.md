Flaky Prompts, Hybrid Approaches, and AI Ambiguity: The Real Challenges of AI Testing

🚀 Balancing Innovation with Caution in AI Testing 🌟

AI-powered testing tools like ZerostepAI promise to revolutionize how we approach automation, offering intelligent solutions for faster and smarter test execution. But as exciting as this innovation is, it's critical to evaluate their limitations and potential risks alongside their strengths.

💡 In one of my recent experiments combining ZerostepAI with Playwright, I discovered:

1️⃣ AI struggles with multi-task prompts, often requiring us to break commands into smaller, more specific steps.

2️⃣ There's ambiguity in context understanding, like confusing columns ("Price" vs. "Discount Price") in a table.

3️⃣ The AI doesn't consistently decide between single vs. multiple outputs, leading to unintended results.

These observations raised vital questions:

Is it our responsibility as testers to craft ultra-specific prompts, or does the tool need better training?
Does AI simplify scripting or make our job longer with added validation efforts?
Can hybrid approaches (e.g., combining AI commands with Playwright scripts) strike the right balance?

My Take:
AI is not a replacement but an augmentation tool, empowering testers to move away from repetitive tasks and focus on complex scenarios. The key lies in understanding when to rely on AI and when to intervene manually.
